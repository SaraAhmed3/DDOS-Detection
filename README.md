# DDOS-Detecti
DDOS Attack is  is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted network by flooding the target or its surrounding infrastructure. In this repository we train an ensemble of models to predict DDOS attacks. The dataset used is CIC-ID2017.
the ensemble consists of a CNN Model and an LSTM model both of which their predictions are given to a Logistic Regresssion Model to draw te final prediction.
